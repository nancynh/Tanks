# Tanks
A game I created for CS-199 GAM

Instructions:
Play against a friend to defeat each other in a battle!

Blue Tank:
WASD to move
SPACE to shoot

Red Tank:
Arrow keys to move
ENTER/RETURN to shoot

Every 5th bullet has some sort of special property. There is a small chance that it can misfire and hit yourself instead.
There are 4 green power ups that boosts the player's health by a random amount. Once these are used, they don't respawn.
